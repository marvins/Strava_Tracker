Strava Analysis
===============

This is an overview of my Strava analysis work.

I frequently ride my bike from work to home.  It's a 17-mile ride and I'm averaging about 71 minutes.  I really, really want to get the ride below 60 minutes. 

To do this, I want to break down the ride and try to analyze where I can make the most improvements. I have outlined the process into the following components. 

1. Import Strava data into a SQLite database. 
2. Compute an "average" route 
3. Tie all datasets against the "average" route.
